\chapter{Ongoing and Future Work}
\label{chap:todo}
As the development is ongoing in Halef, several new features are being added and a bunch of others are being improved.

\section{Areas of improvement}
Throughout the book, a few points have been pointed out as possible areas of addition or improvement.
In this section, those points will be summarized.

\subsection{Plug in - Plug out Nature for Speech Recognizers and Synthesizers}
The Cairo server was developed as a separate project and it shipped with Sphinx4 and FreeTTS integrated into it.
This integration goes into the heart of the Cairo server that it makes the job of adding other speech recognizers and synthesizers more difficult than it should be.
Ideally, Halef should provide an easy interface that allows to plug in and plug out any speech recognizer or synthesizer easily.
This would give Halef maximum flexibility and would allow it to cope with the new technologies as they roll out.
The recognition interface described earlier took a step forwards in this direction, achieving some sort of flexibility and allowing the use of two recognizer types instead of one by adding Sphinx4 ARPA to the originally present Sphinx4 JSGF recongizer.
However, the job of adding a totally different recognizer other than Sphinx4 is still an ongoing work as will be explained later.
During this process, it is expected to meet more areas where the architecture of the Cairo server will have to be changed to provide more separability between it and the Sphinx4 recognizer.
