Spoken Dialog Systems and virtual voice assistants are of increasing importance in today's tech scene.
Virtual voice assistants are constantly increasing the accessibility and efficiency of using technology and so, no smart phone ships without one now.
Companies such as Google and Apple have taken specific interest in this field as they aim to develop more accurate and domain free virtual voice assistants.
In the DHBW Spoken Dialog Systems Research Lab, Halef, a new \ac{sds} was developed.
It consists of three main parts; Asterisk, Cairo and \ac{jvxml}.
Those three parts are installed on different servers forming a distributed architecture, with the servers communicating using the industry standards compliant protocols; \ac{sip} and MRCP.
This work describes how Halef functions, with its different components and distributed architecture, as well as the several changes that were made to each component to suit Halef's needs, improving its efficiency and widening its capabilities.
